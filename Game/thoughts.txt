For BSP:

Need to have a tree of nodes.  Each node 'owns' two more nodes.  Iterate through each node owned by each node, and add two nodes to it.  
Then iterate through each node at the lowest level, and add a room to it.  
Then, create corridors between each room.  These should connect between sister nodes.  So, for node A, the room in A1 connects to the room in A2. 
Then, one of the nodes in A connects to one of the nodes in B.  
Possible add a few wiggly corridors throughout the map, so that there is a bit more randomness.  

I really like BSP at the moment, as it allows me to give each leaf node a chance of having a non-rectangular room in it.

Corridors!

Moves from centre of child 1 to centre of child 2.  Results in straight corridors, but it makes sense for a 'dungeon' biome.
