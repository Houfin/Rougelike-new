What is a map?

An enormous 2D array of tiles.  Each tile is either a wall or not a wall.
This can easily be represented by 1s and 0s.  In general, all other entities such as monsters, items, traps, whatever can just be added on top of this map.
Things like stairs however might be included in the map object.  
Maybe each item in the wall is a Tile object which has attributes such as 'blocks' 'blocks light' 'name' (if these keys pressed and map[x][y].name == "downStairs" etc.)
I like that a lot more, seems to be more more sensible.
